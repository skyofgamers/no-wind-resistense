    <h1>lyrics</h1>
<p>I don't know how it ends, I can't see it in the distance
    But can you ever reach the end of a timeless existence?
    I'll bet ya I can run faster with no wind resistance
    I'll fly under no conditions
    Teach myself complete submission
    While I grant myself complete permission
    Just imagine being human
    Hating your confusion
    Denying 'til it's proven
    Laughing at illusion
    Thinking institution's the solution
    While tyranny and irony float in its pollution
    Imagine reducing yourself to your name
    Janet, you've got no one else you can blame
    You've suck all your consciousness inside of your brain
    So now you just shoot stuff inside of your veins
    So go ahead and find your meaning
    With your methamphetamine
    And once you can see that you've trapped all your grace
    Maybe you'll join me and girl we can race
    I'll bet ya I can run faster with no wind resistance
    I'll fly under no conditions
    Teach myself complete submission
    While I grant myself complete permission
    No streets, receipts
    Off-beat heartbeats
    Just window seats
    For free, for free
    I've been here sixty years and I'm still not bored
    There's absolutely nothing that I can't afford
    And I've found that almost everything is made of cardboard
    And there's absolutely nothing I can't sing with weird chords and
    I can run faster with no wind resistance
    I'll fly under no conditions
    Teach myself complete submission
    While I grant myself complete permission</p>
